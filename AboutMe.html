<h2>About the Wonderful Wizard of Me</h2>

<p class="mix">Hello, my name is Praharshitha. I'm going to tell you a few secrets because we are best friends and have known each other for a long time. #1 My favorite fruit is ... Apples! #2 My favorite color is... Pink! I know, I know, you could've never guessed. It has been very confidential information and it wil stay like that. I told you these secrets because I knew I could trust you. And I hope my trust is right on you. If it isn't, my heart will explode from the sorrow. (Sniff Sniff) Sorry for getting all emotional. I hope you truly know me now. Now if you excuse me, I have some homework to do. (Background music of Bill Nye the Science Guy plays...)</p>
